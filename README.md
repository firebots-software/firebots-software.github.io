# Overview

This repository exists to redirect firebots-software.github.io (the base GitHub pages domain) to the wiki at firebots-software.github.io/wiki. The repository name has to match the github.io web address for it to serve on the root of the domain.

This is also needed so the CNAME record for our domain wiki.fremontrobotics.com (which can only point to the root of a domain) redirects properly to the wiki.
